# Discord-Bot

This is a small tutorial on how to make your discord bot online. There is no coding yet but will be more in the future

Package.json

You need to go to the package.json section and above the code it says add package. Click that, then you can search for packages or bundles.
You want to search discord.js and you will want to add the package called discord.js. It has to be discord.js or it will not work.
